# Form-ValidationJS
Form validation made using only HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS
# How does it work
For validation to work you need to these things correctly: 
* In all of the inputs you need to input something. 
* For email input, your email needs to be correctly written (for example: samedskulj@yahoo.com). This has been done and verified correctly using Regex
* For last two inputs, password and password check, the password you have entered in the first input called "password", you need to also input the same password in "password check"
# How do you know if it worked?
* If you have done everything correctly, you will receive alert after 1 seconds which says: "Uspijesno ste napravili account"
